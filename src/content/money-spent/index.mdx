intro: Christmas can be very expensive. Plot a line of how much americans think they're spending on Christmas gifts over the years.

Today we built a little line chart with two axes and emoji datapoints. Hover an emoji, get a line highlighting where it falls on the axis. Makes it easy to see what happened when.

It's interesting to see how Christmas spending was on the rise and reached a peak in 2007. Crashed in 2008 then started rising again. Great insight into the US economy.

When times are good, people buy gifts. When times are bad, people don't. 🧐

To build this linechart we used the same insight [as yesterday](/christmas-trees/):

> Our data is static and never changes. We don't expect to change positions and size of our chart. That means we can cut some corners.

Once again we load data in `componentDidMount` using `d3.tsv` to parse a tab separated values file.
We feed the result array of objects into a `<Linechart>` component.

## The basic linechart

Rendering a basic linechart was pretty quick: D3's got a line generator 🤙

## The axes

## The 💸 money emojis

## A highlight for easy reading

Enjoy ✌️
